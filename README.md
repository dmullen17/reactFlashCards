## Flash Cards

Welcome to my personal flash cards application! I designed this application so that I could review concepts I've learned each day with my morning coffee.  

## App Strucuture 

### React Components
The `App` component's internal state manages the current question and answer, the current selected topics, and the current available questions.  Its methods allow the user to toggle a topic, go to the next question, show an answer, and reset the application.  The `Topic` component is dynamically generated for each topic in the underlying `questions.json` file.  Its internal state manages whether or not a `Topic` is active. 

### Stateless functional components
`Topics` is a container for and dynamically generates the `Topic` components, and passes the `toggleDisplay` method through props.  `FlashCard` is a container for the displayed question and passes the `nextQuestion` method on through props.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
